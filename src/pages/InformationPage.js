                    <h2>Violence or abuse is not your fault. Everyone has the right to be safe.</h2>
                    <h2>Anyone can experience domestic and family violence or abuse.</h2>
                    <p>Domestic and family violence is when someone is controlling or hurting you.</p>
                    <p>This can include one or more:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Emotional - Putting you down, yelling and swearing, making threats and scaring you.</li>
                        <li>Financial - controlling money, stops you using your money, or stealing your money.</li>
                        <li>Physical - pushing, shoving, kicking, slapping or threatening to do those things.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>All types of violence are serious. Many people who experience domestic violence will never experience physical violence.</p>
