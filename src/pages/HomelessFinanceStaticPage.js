                </ul>
                <h2>Dealing with debt</h2>
                <p>If you can't repay a debt by an agreed date, it is important to seek advice and take action as soon as possible. Unpaid debt may result in seizure of your property or a visit to court.</p>
                <p>You may feel pressured to make a decision or to agree to something when a creditor or debt collector contacts you. You have a right to get financial or legal information and advice before signing or agreeing to anything.</p>
                <p>It is important to remember that you also have the right to be protected from illegal behaviour from creditors and debt collectors. You have the right to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>be treated fairly and not discriminated against</li>
                    <li>have your privacy protected</li>
                    <li>get help</li>
                    <li>question the debt.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Watch out for questionable offers of help</h2>
                <p>Be careful of uninvited offers of help. Some organisations may offer to negotiate with your creditors and to restructure your debts for a fee. They usually write to you after you have been sued. </p>
                <p>Some of these organisations may be okay but others are not. Make sure you get advice from a financial counsellor before signing any contracts.</p>
                <h2>Where can I find homeless financial services?</h2>
