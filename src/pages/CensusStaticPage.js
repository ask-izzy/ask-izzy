                    <p>
                        The Census is a snapshot of everyone in Australia.
                        It is run by the ABS every five years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Census data is used to plan the services we all use.
                        Services like housing, healthcare, and transport.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is important that everyone in Australia be counted
                        wherever they are on Tuesday August 9. This includes
                        people with no fixed address.

                    <p>
                        There will be people at drop in centres, food vans and
                        other services helping people who are sleeping rough,
                        staying temporarily with friends or family, living in
                        boarding houses or staying in hostels to do the Census.

                        If you have no fixed address, or are couch surfing,
                        please write “none” in the suburb/locality box for the
                        usual address question.
