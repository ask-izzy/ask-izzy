# Ask Izzy

## Dependencies

[![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/badges/b91820f574d095d55ce62975008f0151.svg)](https://gemnasium.com/8f187dc904fea1417227ff718eb4200d)

If you're working on this codebase, some understanding of the following will
help:

 * Node/npm
 * webpack
 * React
 * jsx (inline templating)
 * babel (es6 transpiler)
 * [flow typesystem](http://flowtype.org)
 * mocha (unit testing)
 * yadda (BDD testing)

## Getting the code

    git clone git@github.com:ask-izzy/ask-izzy.git
    cd ask-izzy
    npm install
    bower install

## Running the dev server

You will need API keys for [ISS](https://api.serviceseeker.com.au/) and
Google.

    ISS_URL=... GOOGLE_API_KEY=... ./script/dev-server

## Dealing with HTTP and browsers

Ask Izzy is a fully static site in production 
(see `conf/nginx.conf` for the rewrite rules that make this 
work - there is duplicated logic from `routes.js`).

Pages which do not require ISS data are pre-generated and generally work 
without javascript. 
See `HtmlDocument.js`, `server/render-static.js` (prod) and `server/render.js` (dev).

Once the page JS loads:

 * React attaches the react-router component to the document
 * react-router looks at the page url to decide which components to render (see `routes.js`)
 * component 'mount' hooks fire and start fetching data from ISS
 * components build a model of the DOM they expect (in `render`)
 * the page is updated with any differences between the expected DOM and actual DOM (usually none)
 * once any async data arrives from ISS, the page is updated again

## Ask Izzy Routes


Here are the explict paths that AskIzzy supports:

````
/service/<service-id>
/service/<service-id>/

/search/<search-term>
/search/<search-term>/
/search/<search-term>/<personalise-path>
/search/<search-term>/<suburb>-<state>
/search/<search-term>/<suburb>-<state>/
/search/<search-term>/<suburb>-<state>/<personalise-path>
/search/<search-term>/in/<suburb>-<state>
/search/<search-term>/in/<suburb>-<state>/

/category/<category-name>
/category/<category-name>/
/category/<category-name>/in/<suburb>-<state>
/category/<category-name>/in/<suburb>-<state>/

/<category-name>
/<category-name>/
/<category-name>/<suburb>-<state>
/<category-name>/<suburb>-<state>/
/<category-name>/<suburb>-<state>/<personalise-path>
/<category-name>/<personalise-path>

/<static-pages>
/<static-pages>/
````

Examples for routes terms are given below:

````
<service-id> e.g. 820532-infoxchange
<personalise-path> e.g. personalise/, personalise/summary, personalise/page/location
<category-name> e.g. housing, food, money-help
<suburb> e.g. Melbourne, Richmond, Run-O-Waters
<state> e.g. VIC, NSW, Victoria
<static-pages> e.g. about, homeless-shelters
````

Note: Ask Izzy categories or static pages must NEVER be named "search", "static", "session", "service", "category" or "in".

### Building HTML pages
See `server/render-static.js`

### Building JS and CSS

Ask Izzy uses Webpack to organize building JS / CSS.

Webpack configuration is very powerful but unfortunately quite complex.
The current configuration compiles javascript files using babel (for JSX and flow) and CSS files using sass,
then writes the result to `public/static/main-<MD5>.<css|js>`. 
The file `server/webpack-stats.json` is also generated, so that our code can find the
path to the files.

By convention, we have one SCSS and one JS file per react component.
Each component renders an element with a `class` equal to the name of the component.
This class is used in the SCSS file to avoid rules applying to the wrong component.

## Javascript features

The babel compiler and polyfill allows us to use advanced features 
which are not yet available in all browsers.

### Promises, async and await

We've used `async` and `await` extensively in Ask Izzy.
Under the hood these are syntactic sugar for promises 
(which are well documented online).

Any function defined as `async function foo()` will
have its return value converted to a promise (any 
exception will result in a promise error and the 
result is the promise result).

Within an `async function`, you can use `[my variable] = await [a promise]`
which will pause the function until the given promise
resolves to a value or an error. If it's a value it's 
returned, if the promise has an error an exception is 
raised.

Promises are part of the JS standard and are supported
natively in every browser except IE (where they are polyfilled),
but async and await are not yet standardized (see 
https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript-asyncawait 
for the in-progress standard)

## Type system (flowtype)

Flow is configured using the `.flowconfig` file.

All JS files in the repo either start with 
`/* @flow */` if they are typechecked 
or `/* flow:disable */` if they are not.

You can run flow on its own using `./node_modules/.bin/flow`.
It's also run as part of the precommit hooks and in CI.

Libraries which aren't part of the code have type definitions 
in the `interfaces` directory.

## Search query generation

When a `ResultsPage` is added to the page, it builds a query
by calling `issParams` which iterates through 
`personalisationComponents` (inherited from `BaseCategoriesPage`)
and calls `getSearch` to build up a search object which is 
passed to `search` in `iss.js`.

For category pages, `BaseCategoriesPage` checks `constants/categories.js`
to get the list of personalisation components.

If any personalisation component has not been answered, it
will return `null` from `getSearch`, and the `ResultsPage`
will redirect to the personalisation page to answer the question.

The whole personalisation space is a twisty mess of side effects
and inheritance. Changes which fit into the existing model are 
super easy but I would be very careful testing any changes to
the control code.

The question classes mostly derive from `BaseQuestion` or `BaseMultiQuestion`.

## Google services

### Analytics
All google analytics events are sent by calling the `push` method in `google-tag-manager.js`.

### Maps

We use the react-google-maps component to handle the maps integration.

The `removeOutliers` method in `ResultsMap.js` was implemented 
because results sometimes include e.g. a hotline which is headquartered
hundreds of km away. `removeOutliers` is reasonably well commented and 
tested (see `ResultsMapTest.js`) but it is quite complex.

### Directions / travel times

We use the google directions matrix API to fetch transit / walking times.
See `maps.js` for the implementation, called from `iss.js`

### Places autocomplete

We use the google places API to autocomplete place names. 
See `locationSuggestions.js` for implementation.

This approach means that we frequently have bugs where a location
is known to google but not ISS. The obvious fix would be to use ISS 
as the source of location autocomplete data.

## Outstanding issues

The search implementation attempts to build a free-text query.
This is fundamentally not really a workable approach but for 
organisational and technical reasons it's very difficult to 
make changes to ISS3 which serves the queries.

## Tests
All tests live in the `test` toplevel directory.

Unit tests live in `test/unit` and are invoked from `test/unit.js`. They use `mocha`.
BDD features live in `test/features` with step definitions in `test/steps` invoked from `test/yadda.js`. They use `yadda`.
Search features live in `test/search` with step definitions in `test/search-steps` invoked from `test/search.js`. They use `yadda`.

### Forklift / docker

The dockerfile can run the tests but there's currently 
no development server in `invoke.sh` (should be easy to 
fix but I don't use docker locally).

If you're using [forklift](https://github.com/infoxchange/docker-forklift)
then you can add a config file `~/.config/forklift/ask-izzy.yaml`:

    environment:
        ISS_URL: ...
        # ISS_URL: http://localhost:5000
        GOOGLE_API_KEY: ...

And run:

    forklift -- ./script/dev-server

There's also a mock ISS server available as `./script/mock-iss`. This will
start a server on `localhost:5000`.

### Adding new icons

 * Add your icon to https://github.com/ask-izzy/designs
 * The Iconify script requires babel, install by running `sudo npm install -g babel-cli`
 * Run `.script/iconify <path_to_cloned_designs_repo>`

The icons/index.js file will be updated, and a new js file for the icon will be generated in /icons.

## Contributing

Link up the git hooks:

    ln -s ../.githooks .git/hooks

Add the git merge strategies to `.git/config`:

    [include]
        path = ../.gitmerge/strategies

Run the linters:

    ./script/typecheck

Running the tests:

    ./script/unit-test
    ./script/feature-test
    ./script/search-test

Pass `SELENIUM_BROWSER=firefox|phantomjs|chrome` to choose a 
browser to run the feature tests with (default is firefox)

You can pass `BROWSER_LOGS=yes` to dump logs from the browser. Be aware not
all browsers support this.

If you have issues running tests on Ubuntu, follow the steps here:
https://christopher.su/2015/selenium-chromedriver-ubuntu/

Then use Chrome as the selenium browser to run the tests.

If you're using a virtual machine open a terminal in the VM to run them.
